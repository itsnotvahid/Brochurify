## About the Project

An innovative project that simplifies website data extraction and summarization.

Key Technologies:
- FastAPI for backend APIs
- WebSockets for real-time communication
- LLMs for summarization and brochure generation

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsnotvahid/Brochurify.git
   cd Brochurify
   ```

### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   On **Linux/macOS**, run:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

### 3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have `pip` installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 4. **Create a `.env` File:**

   The application requires certain environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   SOCKET_HOST=127.0.0.1
   SOCKET_PORT=8912
   STATIC_HOST=127.0.0.1
   STATIC_PORT=8913
   ```

   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key. Ensure this file is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being tracked by version control.

---

## Usage

To run the application:

### 1. **Start the FastAPI Server with the `run.sh` script:**

   Make sure the `run.sh` script is executable. If not, change its permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```

   Now, run the script:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

### 2. **Access the Application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `"http://STATIC_HOST:STATIC_PORT" to interact with the application.
